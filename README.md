3D fps using Vulkan and modern c++ for the engine

## Summary ##
    
Humans have never been created; during the start of the Cretaceous Period 150 Million Years Ago (After the Jurrassic Period), 
a new form of being came into existence, the **Dracoa**. These creatures started as a infectious bacteria that would feed off of the decomposing 
lifeforms throughout the world. They can survive in extreme temperatures and pressures, and would evolve the decomposing body into a new species. 
Fast forward 500 years, the **Dracoa** have become the dominiant species on earth, because of their innnate ability to replicate from the dead bodies all around. 
However, a rare species of **Dracoa** emerged that was able to have coherent thoughts, not just instinct, and could control those **Dracoa** that were lesser. 
This form is known as an Overmind and comprised of 0.001% of the **Dracoa** population.
  
The Overminds rose incredibly quickly to the top of the food chain, using the lesser **Dracoa** to hunt and gather for them. Over the centuries there has been several 
power struggles between the Overminds, each having very unique abilities. Although they have lived in relative peace for years, they still only possess primative 
technology, since they rely on the lesser **Dracoa** to do their bidding. One day, they are put to the test, when an advanced civilization comes from space to colonize their planet. They must figure out how to negotiate, fightback, 
or they face extinction.

You play as various Overminds, in control of a pack of wights. The wights are the lesser **Dracoa** that only use instincts to survive. You are able to control 
the wights and use your inherent bacteria to infect dead organisms to obtain more wights. Since Overminds have strong mental capacities, 
their physical capacities lack. Therefore, they must attack and defend with their pack of weights by shooting enemies with their attack or action pheromone. 
That is, there will be several kinds of pheremones each commanding the wights to perform a specific action. 
The Overminds and only run and dodge from a distance.

Later on, the Overmind gets physical abilties from consuming a wight. This includes the abilities to attack and defend without wights, etc.

## Technical Details ##

- Modern C++17
- Custom 2D Game Engine built with Vulkan (successor to OpenGL).
- Building the game engine will also require graphics theory discovery and knowledge gain.
- Use Lua or other Scripting language to easily prototype actual game.
